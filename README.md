# Bubbles
A website that allows users to create audioblogs easily and quickly, by using their Facebook Messenger accounts.
Everything from the signup process, to adding new posts and deleting the posts can be done by sending messages to the [facebook page](https://m.me/bubblespodcasts).

The frontend is built using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) without any UI frameworks, and backend uses [Messenger API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/) and [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com), with data being stored in [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com).

#### Note:
  If you try sending messages to the facebook page, the page would not respond unless your facebook account is added as tester to the application, since the apps aren't publicly accessible by default :(. Just send me a text and I'll add you.
